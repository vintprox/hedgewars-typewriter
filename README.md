**Typewriter** Hedgewars Lua library, which wraps up text visuals in Hedgewars with typewriter animations.

Typewriter harnesses [Animate](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/LuaLibraryAnimate) Hedgewars library. Right now, the only function supported is [`Typewriter.AddMissionAnim`](https://github.com/vintprox/hedgewars-typewriter#addmissionanim). It adds ability to draw mission panel with caption, subcaption and text animated in typewriter sequence. See its action in this video:

It's not a secret that animations bring more attention than static panels. You may find it useful for embedding in your campaigns, missions and even multiplayer game styles.

I plan to add more typewriting animations of tags and other GUI with dynamic text, so stay in touch: [press "Watch" here, give a star and/or fork repository](https://github.com/vintprox/hedgewars-typewriter)! We also have discussion at [Hedgewars Forums](https://www.hedgewars.org/node/9156).

## Installation
Take the desired release [here](https://github.com/vintprox/hedgewars-typewriter/releases) in form of `Typewriter_v*.hwp` file, which is recommended for loading addon in Hedgewars. Inside the [user directory](https://www.hedgewars.org/node/6761) find folder `Data` and place downloaded `*.hwp` there.

### Demo
You might wanna try Typewriter without custom script now, so here is `Typewriter_Demo_v*.hwp`. Just place it near by `Typewriter_v*.hwp` file and open in game: `Singleplayer Missions â†’ Scenarios â†’ Typewriter Demo`.

## Usage
Public functions belong to **Typewriter** namespace. You can place them at demand: between, before, or after other animations added with `AddAnim`.

> Keep in mind that flow of animation is asynchronous from the code you call in. To perform actions after animation is complete, use either [`AddAnim`](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/LuaLibraryAnimate#AddAnim(steps)) or [`AddFunction`](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/LuaLibraryAnimate#AddFunction(element)).

### AddMissionAnim
Add whole typewriter animation for mission panel. 

```lua
HedgewarsScriptLoad("/Scripts/Typewriter.lua")

function onGameStart()
    Typewriter.AddMissionAnim({
        caption = "Hello World",
        subcaption = "<3",
        text = "This is just working, alright?"
    })
end
```

Options set is not limited to sole visuals: address to [Typewriter.lua](./addon/Scripts/Typewriter.lua) for more verbose information.

#### Everything's optional (including icon)
Of course, table is here to not confuse order of parameters, it can be ordered however you like. Actually, you can omit everything, because they are optional as long as you have proper globals set up. Here's the example:
```lua
Typewriter.Mission.caption = "My Super Campaign"
Typewriter.AddMissionAnim({
    text = "Your fort is in danger! | Go place some girders.",
    icon = 2
})
```
This way, only detail text appears animated, caption will be shown instantly as common mark between your missions (same applies to subcaption, here it's empty by default).

You also can set icon passed to [ShowMission](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/LuaGUI#ShowMission(caption,_subcaption,_text,_icon,_time_[,_forceDisplay])). Check out [ammo types](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/AmmoTypes) for more icons (these constants require prepended minus sign).

#### Customize or disable sounds
```lua
Typewriter.AddMissionAnim({
    text = "Collect box on the other side of street",
    sound_typing = false,
    sound_return = sndMineTick
})
```
Here we completely disabled typing sound, but also changed another sound that plays when whole animation is considered complete.

#### Change behavior on animations' end
```lua
Typewriter.AddMissionAnim({
    subcaption = "same day, 9:00 PM",
    text = "Suppose we have a long text here...",
    display_time_after = 5000,
    force_display_after = true
})
```
Usually, we forcedly display mission panel only during animations. When all text was typed, default display time is ~3000ms, and player can easily hide panel by pressing <kbd>M</kbd>. But if `force_display_after` is truthy, mission panel will be forcedly shown during `display_time_after` extra time.

#### Set delays
You would probably like to set delays globally, so here is an example:
```lua
Typewriter.Mission.delay_caption_start = 1000
Typewriter.Mission.delay_caption_char = 200
Typewriter.Mission.delay_subcaption_start = 500
Typewriter.Mission.delay_subcaption_char = 150
Typewriter.Mission.delay_text_start = 400
Typewriter.Mission.delay_text_char = 100
Typewriter.Mission.delay_return = 2000
```
This particular example guarantees irritatingly slower experience for a player. ðŸ˜œ

However, you can find more optimal values based on your mission's setting. These are available even per one command.

#### Mission panel as cinematic monologue
By default, all mission panels are intended to be important to look at, so you won't miss the last one after skipping animation with [SetAnimSkip](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/LuaLibraryAnimate#SetAnimSkip(bool)). But what if you wish to use mission panel as element of monologue or for any reason hide said panel if player skips over it? That's when you set:
```lua
Typewriter.AddMissionAnim({
    text = "Yeah-yeah, don't listen to me.",
    modal = false
})
```
